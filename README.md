# Takeout-Ordering-Application

This is a simple Python-based receipt printing system that takes a list of items purchased by a customer and generates an itemized receipt. It includes functions to print an itemized list, along with the menu item name, price, quantity, and total price. The receipt is formatted for easy reading, simulating the structure of a typical point-of-sale (POS) receipt.

## Features
- Receipt Heading: Prints a heading at the top of the receipt (store name, date, and time).
- Itemized List: Loops through the purchased items, printing their names, quantities, and prices.
- Total Calculation: Calculates and prints the total amount of the purchase.
- Formatted Output: Each line of the receipt is clearly separated with formatting to ensure readability.
- Customizable: Easily extend the code to include additional receipt details, like taxes or discounts.

## Installation
To use this receipt printing system, you just need Python installed on your computer.

1. Clone the repository
    Copy code
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd receipt-printing-system

2. Set up your environment (if needed)
Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can check by running:
    Copy code
    python --version
If it's not installed, download and install Python.

3. Install dependencies (if any)
If there are any required libraries (none were mentioned, so this step may not be needed), you can install them using pip:
    Copy code
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Define your receipt: The receipt is passed as a list of dictionaries, each representing an item. Each dictionary should contain:
- Item name: The name of the menu item (string).
- Price: The price of the item (float).
- Quantity: The quantity of the item purchased (integer).

2. Print the receipt: Call print_itemized_receipt with the receipt data.

## Code Structure
- print_receipt_heading(): Prints the receipt heading (store name, date, time).
- print_receipt_line(item_name, price, quantity): Prints each individual line of the receipt (item name, price, quantity, and total for the item).
- print_itemized_receipt(receipt): Loops through the receipt data and prints the itemized list, calling print_receipt_line for each item.
